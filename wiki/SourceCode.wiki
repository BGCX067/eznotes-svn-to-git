            “Table Views and Navigation Controllers - iPhone SDK Tutorial” By: HDiPhone.
                + This YouTube demonstration was used for learning and support in creating our navigation based table view setup in EZNotes. It showed us how to use multiple ViewControllers to go deeper in our navigation of our application. This tutorial also showed us how to setup and add items into a standard table view.
                      # Some source code was borrowed and used within all of our ViewControllers including:
                            * NoteViewController.h, RootViewController.h, KeyboardViewController.h (and all their respective implementation (m) files.

                + The following is also a combination of downloadable source code and video tutorial. This tutorial shed some light for us in using NSKeyedArchivers and NSKeyedUnarchivers to save and load. This tutorial made massive contributions to the way we approach saving our “Note” datum into an array.
